### Installation
1. Install all required dependencies
2. Clone this repo into `~/.dotfiles`
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CallMeEchoCodes/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
```
3. Delete or move any existing configuration files you might have
4. Install the dotfiles
```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
dossier install
```
5. Edit the settings <br/>
I tried not to hardcode personal stuff but it was kinda required in places. I'll note those here:
* `hyprland/settings.conf` contains monitor config and personal settings (explained in comments)
* `eww/scripts/workspaces` contains more monitor config
* `fish/config.fish` currently contains some stuff that requires my personal sysfetch. I'll move that to `personal.fish` soon.
* `fontconfig/fonts.conf` contains fonts to change
* `rofi/theme.rasi` contains another font to change
* `wezterm/wezterm.lua` guess what? more fonts.
I think thats all of them but I might have missed some and I would recommend just going through everything to tweak it to your preferences. If you find any hardcoded stuff specific to my system make an issue.
6. Run `dbus-run-session Hyprland` from a TTY to open Hyprland!
